# Anime and Manga List

As someone who watches anime every week, I have started a lot of animes. Some of them I have finished while others i have not. I created this anime and manga (for those of you who enjoy reading mangas) list in order to make it easier to keep track of which animes I have seen, which animes I have finished, and which animes that I enjoyed. The app will fulfill all these functions by providing an index of animes/mangas where you can add them to your own personal list, rating the anime/manga on your personal list out of 5 stars, marking whether you have finished the anime/manga, and having the ability to write a comment for the anime/manga.

Users are able to sign up and login/logout. After logging in users are able to leave comments and add animes/mangas to their own personal list. Users are also able to rate the animes on their list out of 5 stars as well as mark whether they have finished the anime/manga.

Technologies include Ruby on Rails backend, PostgreSQL database, React.js frontend, AniList API, graphQL database
Optional: Add screenshots or gifs of your application
